# Image-Recognition

This repository contains the source code for a project that tackles the exciting challenge of implementing an image recognition system using deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the Keras framework in Python. The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and accurate model capable of identifying objects or patterns within images, thereby enabling a wide range of applications, from computer vision in autonomous vehicles to content filtering in social media platforms.
